**Important**: 
-  For this tutorial and practical project, I'm using *SqlServer*. To recreate it, be sure to have both *SqlServer* and *SqlServer Management Studio (SSMS)* installed.
<br>
-  The following steps will consider a few things: 
	1. You have the required installations above; 
	2. You have certain knowledge on databases design and SQL; 
	3. You already have you SqlServer local server.
	
## Creating and connecting to a database

-  First step is to create a database for the project.
-  For next, you have to connect you application the db using a connection string.

##### Conn String:

-  Access the *appsettings.json* file and add the following connection properties:

```json
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "ConnString": "Server=localhost, 1433; Initial Catalog=courseapi; Integrated Security=true; Trust Server Certificate=true" 
  },
```

##### Entity Framework:

-  This framework is an Objected-Relational-Mapping (ORM) tool for .NET applications.
-  Download the ***Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer*** package using the *NuGet package manager.*
-  Download also  ***Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools***
-  The framework needs a classed called **Context**: it will be the bridge between our code and our database:
	1.  Create a folder named "Data" in your project.
	2.  Add the Context class: The Entity Framework provides a parent class for this, the **DbContext** class.
	3.  Add DbSet Attributes representing each Entity.
	4.  Setup the ***Program.cs*** file

```c#
public class DataContext : DbContext
{
    public DataContext(DbContextOptions<DataContext> options) : base(options) { }
    public DbSet<Author> Authors { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Book> Books { get; set; }
}
``` 

*Program.cs:*

``` c#
builder.Services.AddDbContext<DataContext>(options =>
{
    options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("ConnString"));
});
```


-  Adicionar *migration* para a db, rodar no terminal de gerenciador de pacotes:
		`Add-Migration InitialMigration`
		`Update-Database` -> Migration Ã© rodada e as tabelas criadas no banco
